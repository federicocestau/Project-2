# Project-2

Using a CSV file I created two bar charts using Plotly, Java Script and D3. The first chart is to classify the videos by score from 1 to 5. For the Second chart I used the unixReviewTime which is a system for describing a point in time.I counted the number of times each value appeared and qualified them between different variables called: popularDays, normalDays, slowDays and ultraslowdays.
